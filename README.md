## What is PLANet?
* PLANet is a time management library that automates the process of organizing your schedule.
* PLANet takes your current schedule, your preferences and the different events and tasks that you want to add to that schedule and gives you the optimal schedule for your preferences.
* PLANet lets you group together different tasks and time-slots according to category and importance so that your schedule suits your specific needs!
* PLANet can split up different tasks so you can use your time more efficiently.
